abstract: Firefighter’s interventions under dense smoke and flames are hazardous and
  ideally need an efficient in-advance geo-located actuation plan. The existing communication
  and sensing technologies should be customized, optimized, and integrated to better
  know the conditions (flame locations, air condition) before and during the rescue
  team’s interventions. In this paper, we propose a firefighter intervention architecture,
  which consists of several sensing devices (flame detectors, carbon dioxide air content)
  a navigation platform (an autonomous ground wheeled robot), and a communication/localization
  network (BLE IoT network) that can be used before and during an intervention in
  rescue or fire extinguishing missions even for indoor or confined spaces. The paper’s
  key novelty presents our integrated solution, giving some key implementation details
  and an intensive experimentation campaign in two real firefighter scenarios with
  real controlled fires. Results carried out in these real indoor scenarios are presented
  to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. A fire detection system is proposed
  to improve fire focus in real time and moving in confined spaces with no visibility
  and physical references. The results obtained in the experimentation show the proposal’s
  effectiveness in locating the fire focus’s position and orientation reducing time
  and risk exposure. This kind of location-aware fire integrated systems would significantly
  impact the speed and security of first responder interventions.
