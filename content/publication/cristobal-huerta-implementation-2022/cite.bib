 abstract = {Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era, as the interpretation of the smart city at each person’s level, present several challenges associated with interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The Continua Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application communication to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper, we describe the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level (SpO2) measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition, respectively, and a smartphone IEEE manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over the Bluetooth Health Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they are part of a telemonitoring system. This system was evaluated in a sample composed of 10 volunteers (mean age 29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG signal sitting and at rest, before and after exercising for 15 min. Physiological measurements were assessed and compared against commercial devices, and our expert physician did not find any relevant differences in the ECG signal. Additionally, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing different heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate was under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively.},
