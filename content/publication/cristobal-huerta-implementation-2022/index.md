abstract: Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era, as the interpretation
  of the smart city at each person’s level, present several challenges associated
  with interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The Continua
  Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application communication
  to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper, we describe
  the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level (SpO2) measurements
  and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition, respectively, and a smartphone IEEE
  manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over the Bluetooth Health
  Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they are part of a telemonitoring
  system. This system was evaluated in a sample composed of 10 volunteers (mean age
  29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation
  consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG signal sitting and at rest, before and after
  exercising for 15 min. Physiological measurements were assessed and compared against
  commercial devices, and our expert physician did not find any relevant differences
  in the ECG signal. Additionally, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing
  different heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate
  was under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively.
