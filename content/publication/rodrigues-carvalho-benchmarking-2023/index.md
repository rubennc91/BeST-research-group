abstract: 'Nowadays, robotic technology for gait training is becoming a common tool
  in rehabilitation hospitals. However, its effectiveness is still controversial.
  Traditional control strategies do not adequately integrate human intention and interaction
  and little is known regarding the impact of exoskeleton control strategies on muscle
  coordination, physical effort, and user acceptance. In this article, we benchmarked
  three types of exoskeleton control strategies in a sample of seven healthy volunteers:
  trajectory assistance (TC), compliant assistance (AC), and compliant assistance
  with EMG-Onset stepping control (OC), which allows the user to decide when to take
  a step during the walking cycle. This exploratory study was conducted within the
  EUROBENCH project facility. Experimental procedures and data analysis were conducted
  following EUROBENCH’s protocols. Specifically, exoskeleton kinematics, muscle activation,
  heart and breathing rates, skin conductance, as well as user-perceived effort were
  analyzed. Our results show that the OC controller showed robust performance in detecting
  stepping intention even using a corrupt EMG acquisition channel. The AC and OC controllers
  resulted in similar kinematic alterations compared to the TC controller. Muscle
  synergies remained similar to the synergies found in the literature, although some
  changes in muscle contribution were found, as well as an overall increase in agonist-antagonist
  co-contraction. The OC condition led to the decreased mean duration of activation
  of synergies. These differences were not reflected in the overall physiological
  impact of walking or subjective perception. We conclude that, although the AC and
  OC walking conditions allowed the users to modulate their walking pattern, the application
  of these two controllers did not translate into significant changes in the overall
  physiological cost of walking nor the perceived experience of use. Nonetheless,
  results suggest that both AC and OC controllers are potentially interesting approaches
  that can be explored as gait rehabilitation tools. Furthermore, the INTENTION project
  is, to our knowledge, the first study to benchmark the effects on human–exoskeleton
  interaction of three different exoskeleton controllers, including a new EMG-based
  controller designed by us and never tested in previous studies, which has made it
  possible to provide valuable third-party feedback on the use of the EUROBENCH facility
  and testbed, enriching the apprenticeship of the project consortium and contributing
  to the scientific community.'
