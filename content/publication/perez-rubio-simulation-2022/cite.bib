 abstract = {This work presents the CODEUS platform, which includes a simulation tool together with an online experimental demonstrator to offer analysis and testing flexibility for researchers and developers in Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning Systems (UIPSs). The simulation platform allows most common encoding techniques and sequences to be tested in a configurable UIPS. It models the signal modulation and processing, the ultrasonic transducers’ response, the beacon distribution, the channel propagation effects, the synchronism, and the application of different positioning algorithms. CODEUS provides results and performance analysis for different metrics and at different stages of the signal processing. The UIPS simulation tool is specified by means of the MATLAB© App-Designer environment, which enables the definition of a user-friendly interface. It has also been linked to an online demonstrator that can be managed remotely by means of a website, thus avoiding any hardware requirement or equipment on behalf of researchers. This demonstrator allows the selected transmission schemes, modulation or encoding techniques to be validated in a real UIPS, therefore enabling a fast and easy way of carrying out experimental tests in a laboratory environment, while avoiding the time-consuming tasks related to electronic design and prototyping in the UIPS field. Both simulator and online demonstrator are freely available for researchers and students through the corresponding website.},
