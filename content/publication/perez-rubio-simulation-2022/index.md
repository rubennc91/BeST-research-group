abstract: This work presents the CODEUS platform, which includes a simulation tool
  together with an online experimental demonstrator to offer analysis and testing
  flexibility for researchers and developers in Ultrasonic Indoor Positioning Systems
  (UIPSs). The simulation platform allows most common encoding techniques and sequences
  to be tested in a configurable UIPS. It models the signal modulation and processing,
  the ultrasonic transducers’ response, the beacon distribution, the channel propagation
  effects, the synchronism, and the application of different positioning algorithms.
  CODEUS provides results and performance analysis for different metrics and at different
  stages of the signal processing. The UIPS simulation tool is specified by means
  of the MATLAB© App-Designer environment, which enables the definition of a user-friendly
  interface. It has also been linked to an online demonstrator that can be managed
  remotely by means of a website, thus avoiding any hardware requirement or equipment
  on behalf of researchers. This demonstrator allows the selected transmission schemes,
  modulation or encoding techniques to be validated in a real UIPS, therefore enabling
  a fast and easy way of carrying out experimental tests in a laboratory environment,
  while avoiding the time-consuming tasks related to electronic design and prototyping
  in the UIPS field. Both simulator and online demonstrator are freely available for
  researchers and students through the corresponding website.
